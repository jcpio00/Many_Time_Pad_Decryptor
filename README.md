# Many_Time_Pad_Decryptor
This program attempts to decrypt a target cipher using XOR analysis and cribb dragging given other ciphertexts encrypted with the same key.
With the use of multiple ciphertexts and a target ciphertext encrypted with the same key.
1. Attempts to decrypt by XORing and analyzing character frequencies.
2. Using the attempted decryption cribb dragg and guess the possible plaintext and save the key fragments. 
3. Decrypt all ciphers using the last known or guessed key fragments.
